## ‚öôÔ∏è Function

Enhances the performance and power management on Nvidia Optimus Laptops, by properly selecting when to use each GPU.

The Nvidia GPU runs the whole desktop, while the Intel/AMD GPU acts as relay between the Nvidia GPU and the screen.

## üñ•Ô∏è Supported platforms

- Graphic protocols: Xorg, Wayland without configurable options.
- Display managers : SDDM, LightDM, GDM, [custom](https://github.com/Askannz/optimus-manager/wiki/FAQ,-common-issues,-troubleshooting#my-display-manager-is-not-sddm-lightdm-nor-sddm), [none](https://github.com/Askannz/optimus-manager/wiki/FAQ,-common-issues,-troubleshooting#i-do-not-use-a-display-manager-i-use-startx-or-xinit).


## üíΩ Installation

Remove interfering tools:

* Tools that handle switching by themselves, like the `bumblebee` package.

* Configs generated by `nvidia-xconfig` utility or the `Save to X Configuration File` button in the Nvidia control panel, at `/etc/X11/xorg.conf`.

* The `nvidia-xrun` package and its [configs](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Nvidia-xrun#Configuration).

* Anything GPU related at `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/`.

* GPU monitoring apps: Uninstall or close before switching to integrated mode, as they may prevent unloading the Nvidia driver.

If using gdm:
- Install [gdm-prime](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gdm-prime/).
- At `/etc/gdm/custom.conf`, remove the `#` before `#WaylandEnable=false`.

In any case:
- Install the Nvidia drivers. If your card is [Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_(microarchitecture)#Products_using_Turing) or later, favor `nvidia-open`.
- Install the `optimus-manager` package. In the AUR: [`optimus-manager-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/optimus-manager-git).


## üìù Configuration

See `/etc/optimus-manager/`.

Power management is disabled by default, as it is hardware specific. For enabling it see [the guide on power management](https://github.com/Askannz/optimus-manager/wiki/A-guide--to-power-management-options).


## üîÄ Modes

* `nvidia` switches to the Nvidia GPU.
* `integrated` switches to the integrated GPU, and powers the Nvidia GPU off.
* `hybrid` switches to the integrated GPU, but leaves the Nvidia GPU available for on-demand offloading. Similar to how Optimus works on Windows. More info at [the Wiki](https://github.com/Askannz/optimus-manager/wiki/Nvidia-GPU-offloading-for-%22hybrid%22-mode).

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:
- In the configuration file, if `auto_logout=yes`, switching will log out and close all applications.
- Switching to and from "integrated" mode can be unstable.


## üìé System Tray

All desktops:
* [`optimus-manager-qt`](https://github.com/Shatur95/optimus-manager-qt).

Gnome:
* [`optimus-manager-indicator`](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2908/optimus-manager-indicator/).
* [`optimus-manager-argos`](https://github.com/inzar98/optimus-manager-argos).


## üé∞ Boot entries

Useful if you want to have different entries for different GPU startup modes.

This only affects which GPU your desktop session starts with, nothing prior to that.

Edit your boot loader config to have the kernel parameter `optimus-manager.startup=[nvidia\integrated\hybrid]`.

Or if you are using the GRUB bootloader, you can use [`optimus-manager-grub`](https://github.com/hakasapl/optimus-manager-grub).


## üìú Terminal

- `optimus-manager --switch [nvidia\integrated\hybrid]`
