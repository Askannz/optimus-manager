# This parameter defines the method used to power switch the Nvidia card. See the documentation
# for a complete description of what each value does. Possible values :
#
# - nouveau : load the nouveau module on the Nvidia card.
# - bbswitch : power off the card using the bbswitch module (requires the bbswitch dependency).
# - acpi_call : try various ACPI method calls to power the card on and off (requires the acpi_call dependency)
# - none : do not use an external module for power management. For some laptop models it's preferable to
#           use this option in combination with pci_power_control (see below). You can use the scipts
#           nvidia-enable.sh and nvidia-disable.sh to execute custom commands for power management.
switching=nouveau

# Enable PCI power management in Intel mode.
# This option is incompatible with acpi_call and bbswitch, so it will be ignored in those cases.
pci_power_control=yes

# Reset the Nvidia card at the PCI level before reloading the nvidia module.
# May fix some switching issues but also cause instability.
pci_reset=no

# Remove the Nvidia card from the PCI bus before powering off.
# May prevent crashes caused by power switching.
pci_remove=no

# Automatically log out the current desktop session when switching GPUs.
# This feature is currently supported for the following DE/WM :
# KDE Plasma, GNOME, XFCE, Deepin, i3, Openbox
# If this option is disabled or you use a different desktop environment,
# GPU switching only becomes effective at the next graphical session login.
auto_logout=yes


[intel]

# Driver to use for the Intel GPU. Possible values : modesetting, intel
# To use the intel driver, you need to install the package "xf86-video-intel".
driver=modesetting

# Acceleration method (corresponds to AccelMethod in the Xorg configuration).
# Only applies to the intel driver.
# Possible values : sna, xna
# Leave blank for the default (no option specified)
accel=

# Enable TearFree option in the Xorg configuration.
# Only applies to the intel driver.
# Possible values : yes, no
# Leave blank for the default (no option specified)
tearfree=

# DRI version. Possible values : 2, 3
DRI=3

# Whether or not to enable modesetting for the nouveau driver.
# Does not affect modesetting for the Intel GPU driver !
# This option only matters if you use nouveau as the switching backend.
modeset=yes

[nvidia]

# Whether or not to enable modesetting. Required for PRIME Synchronization (which prevents tearing).
modeset=yes

# Whether or not to enable the NVreg_UsePageAttributeTable option in the Nvidia driver.
# Recommended, can cause poor CPU performance otherwise.
PAT=yes

# DPI value. This will be set using the Xsetup script passed to your login manager.
# It will run the command
# xrandr --dpi <DPI>
# Leave blank for the default (the above command will not be run).
DPI=96


# Comma-separated list of Nvidia-specific options to apply.
# Available options :
# - overclocking : enable CoolBits in the Xorg configuration, which unlocks clocking options
#   in the Nvidia control panel.
# - triple_buffer : enable triple buffering.
options=overclocking
