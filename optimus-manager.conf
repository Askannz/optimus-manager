[optimus]

# This parameter defines the method used to power switch the Nvidia card. See the documentation
# for a complete description of what each value does. Possible values :
#
# - nouveau : load the nouveau module on the Nvidia card.
# - bbswitch : power off the card using the bbswitch module (requires the bbswitch dependency).
# - acpi_call : try various ACPI method calls to power the card on and off (requires the acpi_call dependency)
# - custom: use custom scripts at /etc/optimus-manager/nvidia-enable.sh and /etc/optimus-manager/nvidia-disable.sh
# - none : do not use an external module for power management. For some laptop models it's preferable to
#          use this option in combination with pci_power_control (see below).
switching=none

# Enable PCI power management in "integrated" mode.
# This option is incompatible with acpi_call and bbswitch, so it will be ignored in those cases.
pci_power_control=no

# Remove the Nvidia card from the PCI bus.
# May prevent crashes caused by power switching.
# Ignored if switching=nouveau or switching=bbswitch.
pci_remove=no

# Reset the Nvidia card at the PCI level before reloading the nvidia module.
# Ensures the card is in a fresh state before reloading the nvidia module.
# May fix some switching issues. Possible values :
#
# - no : does not perform any reset
# - function_level : perform a light "function-level" reset
# - hot_reset : perform a "hot reset" of the PCI bridge. ATTENTION : this method messes with the hardware
#         directly, please read the online documentation of optimus-manager before using it.
#         Also, it will perform a PCI remove even if pci_remove=no.
#
pci_reset=no

# Automatically log out the current desktop session when switching GPUs.
# This feature is currently supported for the following DE/WM :
# GNOME, KDE Plasma, LXDE, Deepin, Xfce, i3, Openbox, AwesomeWM, bspwm and dwm
# If this option is disabled or you use a different desktop environment,
# GPU switching only becomes effective at the next graphical session login.
auto_logout=yes

# GPU mode to use at computer startup.
# Possible values: nvidia, integrated, hybrid, auto, intel (deprecated, equivalent to integrated)
# "auto" is a special mode that auto-detects if the computer is running on battery
# and selects a proper GPU mode. See the other options below.
startup_mode=integrated
# GPU mode to select when startup_mode=auto and the computer is running on battery.
# Possible values: nvidia, integrated, hybrid, intel (deprecated, equivalent to integrated)
startup_auto_battery_mode=integrated
# GPU mode to select when startup_mode=auto and the computer is running on external power.
# Possible values: nvidia, integrated, hybrid, intel (deprecated, equivalent to integrated)
startup_auto_extpower_mode=nvidia


[intel]

# Driver to use for the Intel GPU. Possible values : modesetting, intel
# To use the intel driver, you need to install the package "xf86-video-intel".
driver=modesetting

# Acceleration method (corresponds to AccelMethod in the Xorg configuration).
# Only applies to the intel driver.
# Possible values : sna, xna, uxa
# Leave blank for the default (no option specified)
accel=

# Enable TearFree option in the Xorg configuration.
# Only applies to the intel driver.
# Possible values : yes, no
# Leave blank for the default (no option specified)
tearfree=

# DRI version. Possible values : 2, 3
DRI=3

# Whether or not to enable modesetting for the nouveau driver.
# Does not affect modesetting for the Intel GPU driver !
# This option only matters if you use nouveau as the switching backend.
modeset=yes


[amd]

# Driver to use for the AMD GPU. Possible values : modesetting, amdgpu
# To use the amdgpu driver, you need to install the package "xf86-video-amdgpu".
driver=modesetting

# Enable TearFree option in the Xorg configuration.
# Only applies to the amdgpu driver.
# Possible values : yes, no
# Leave blank for the default (no option specified)
tearfree=

# DRI version. Possible values : 2, 3
DRI=3


[nvidia]

# Whether or not to enable modesetting. Required for PRIME Synchronization (which prevents tearing).
modeset=yes

# Whether or not to enable the NVreg_UsePageAttributeTable option in the Nvidia driver.
# Recommended, can cause poor CPU performance otherwise.
PAT=yes

# DPI value. This will be set using the Xsetup script passed to your login manager.
# It will run the command
# xrandr --dpi <DPI>
# Leave blank for the default (the above command will not be run).
DPI=96

# If you're running an updated version of xorg-server (let's say to get PRIME Render offload enabled),
# the nvidia driver may not load because of an ABI version mismatch. Setting this flag to "yes"
# will allow the loading of the nvidia driver.
ignore_abi=no

# Set to yes if you want to use optimus-manager with external Nvidia GPUs (experimental)
allow_external_gpus=no

# Comma-separated list of Nvidia-specific options to apply.
# Available options :
# - overclocking : enable CoolBits in the Xorg configuration, which unlocks clocking options
#   in the Nvidia control panel. Note: does not work in hybrid mode.
# - triple_buffer : enable triple buffering.
options=overclocking


# Enable Runtime D3 (RTD3) Power Management in the Nvidia driver. While in hybrid mode,
# this feature allows the Nvidia card to go into a low-power mode if it's not in use.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# - The feature is still experimental
# - It's only supported on laptops with a Turing GPU or above, and an Intel Coffee Lake CPU
# or above (not sure about the state of support for AMD CPUs).
# - if your Nvidia card also has an audio chip (for HDMI) or a USB port wired to it, they may not
# function properly while in low-power mode
#
# For more details, see
# https://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/460.39/README/dynamicpowermanagement.html
#
# Available options:
# - no (the default): RTD3 power management is disabled.
# - coarse: the card only goes to low-power if no application is using it.
# - fine: the card is also allowed to go to low-power if applications are using it but have not
# actively submitted GPU work in some amount of time.
dynamic_power_management=no

# The Nvidia driver handles power to the video memory separately from the rest of GPU.
# When dynamic_power_management=fine, this options controls the threshold of memory utilization
# (in Megabytes) under which the memory is put in a low-power state.
# Values over 200MB are ignored. Leave blank for the default (200MB).
# Setting this value to 0 keeps the memory powered at all times.
